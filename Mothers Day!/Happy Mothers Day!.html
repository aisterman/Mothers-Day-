            <h2>Hey Amma,</h2>
            <p>You know, in a world full of stars, you shine the brightest. You're like my guiding light, always there to lead me through every twist and turn in life.</p>
            <p>On Mother's Day, I just have to tell you, you're everything to me. Your love is like no other, it's so real, so true. It's like that feeling you get when you see the morning dew or the sky so blue â€“ just pure and beautiful.</p>
            <p>Remember all those times you held me close, with your gentle touch and those loving eyes that always understood? Every hug, every kiss, it's like I'm wrapped in a blanket of your love. It's like my own little piece of heaven.</p>
            <p>And Amma, through all the ups and downs, you've been right there by my side. Your wisdom, your strength, it's what keeps me going. In your embrace, I find this incredible sense of belonging, like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.</p>
            <p>We've made so many memories together, shared countless dreams. Your love has been the soundtrack to my life, the beat to my favorite song. I can't imagine a world without your love, Amma.</p>
            <p>Every step I take, I feel your presence, your support. Your love, it's like this unstoppable force that propels me forward. It gives me the courage to face whatever comes my way.</p>
            <p>And Amma, even when things get tough, your love never wavers. It's like this burning flame that never goes out. In your eyes, I see my worth, I see the person you've helped me become.</p>
            <p>Through thick and thin, through every trend, your love has been my constant. You're not just my Amma, you're my best friend. Iâ€™ve said it before and ill say it again, I love you.</p>
            <p>I know we aren't together this Mothers Day, but  I want you to know that you're always close to my heart. I may not be able to be there in person to celebrate with you, but know I miss you</p>
            <p>Happy Mothers Day!</p>
            <p>XoXo</p>
